# ZenTrails

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## NOTES

1. the company CRUD uses the locator.dart file.
2. splash page and auth uses the app_state with inherited widget.
3. the other queries are directly with firestore methods.
